<h1>What Is Expense Tracking?</h1>



<h3>
    Expense tracking means recording all your expenditures so you have a clear and detailed understanding of your
    budget. This is typically done for a certain project or over a certain period, so you can stay on budget and make
    any necessary adjustments.

    For many small businesses, expense tracking may include fixed expenses like rent and utilities as well as
    fluctuating costs like labor, product orders, and advertising. It?s especially important to record one-time and
    variable costs, as these aren?t always accounted for in the initial budget.
